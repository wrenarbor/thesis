#Praat script which produces the first four spectral moments from fricative spectra. The DFTs are
#averaged using time-averaging (Shadle 2012). The fricative signals should not be upsampled, so if
#the signal is sampled at under 44.1 kHz, please adjust the Resampling rate to match that of the
#original recording. Within time-averaging, a number of DFTs are taken from across the duration of
#the fricative. These DFTs are averaged for each token and then the moments are calculated. The
#analyzed duration of the fricative is always equivalent to the center 80% of the total duration,
#cutting off the transitions.

#Note that the duration of these DFTs (window size) multiplied by the number of DFTs (window number)
#should equal a value no greater than 1.6 times the duration of the sound file to be analyzed.
#In other words, if you set the window size to 15 ms and the window number to 6, the sum of all
#window durations is equal to 90 ms. This number of windows works fine for a total fricative duration
#down to 56 ms, but no lower. The reason for this is that the windows should overlap only up to 50%
#over the duration of the fricative. If they overlap more than this, certain parts of the duration
#(in the center) get more heavily weighted than others. The value of 1.6 derives from the fact that
#the analyzed duration is only 80% of the duration of the total. Thus, the sum of the windows may
#only be twice of this 80% value, or 160% of the total duration.

#Version 2.0 revised 2017 to fix an issue with intensity averaging. Thanks to Ting Huang at
#Taiwan Tsing Hua University for pointing this error out to me.

#Version 3.0 revised in 2021 to fix some minor issues with sampling rate.

#Version 4.0 revised in 2021 with extensive help by Wei Rong Chen and Christine
#Shadle at Haskins Labs. The newest version applies an improved function
#in calculating the amplitude of frequency bins and does not utilize Praat's built-in
#functions for spectral moments, but calculates them using methods discussed in
